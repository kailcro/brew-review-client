# Brew Review Client
Brew Review is an application that allows users to read and review different beers. The original idea came from my love of good beer, and well, my hate of bad beer. The cool thing about beer is that my idea of a "good beer", can be wildly different from your idea of a "good beer". Beers come in all different flavors - and their goodness is subjective!

My idea was to build an application that for allowed people to get a better idea if a particular beer is something they would enjoy.

## Problem Solving
This application was my first attempt at building out a full stack application. My main focus was on the server side, ensuring I set up my API correctly. But of course, I could have begun to build out my back-end without creating a solid plan for my client side. My problem solving story started by white boarding out the functionalities a user would be looking for when interacting with a beer review application. Form there I built out my wireframes.

After having my wireframes nailed down, I built out my API. You can check that repo out [here](https://github.com/kailcro/brew-review_backend). After that, I used Handlebars to index beers on the page, and used Bootstrap for my styling. Overall, it was a lot of fun to see this application come to life.
